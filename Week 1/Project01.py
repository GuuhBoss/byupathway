print(f"""Last week, something strange happened.
I was walking home when I noticed a {adjective} {animal} {verb1} in the middle of the sidewalk.
\"{exclamation.capitalize()}!\" I shouted.
Without thinking, I started to {verb2} as loudly as I could.
Somehow, that made it {verb3} in place, and then it decided to leap right over a trash can and disappear!
Then, out of nowhere, it dropped a {story_object} that made a loud "{sound}" when it hit the ground.
I just stood there, questioning my life choices.""")
